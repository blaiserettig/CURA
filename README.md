CURA, the Chapman University Roompact Assistant, is a project I am developing as part of my Software Engineering Internship with Residence Life and First-Year Experience (RLFYE) at Chapman University. 

It is a GUI tool developed in Python with the use of Tkinter and Selenium to network and automate form submissions on the housing management system RLFYE uses, Roompact.
